# PLOG-MOD-X

Graphical interface for a boardgame with artificial inteligence, developed in Prolog.

The interface works in a browser and shows the board and pieces in 3D with a user-friendly interface to play the game (a menu in the window corner allows to select different cameras, environments, game modes, undo plays and see the game movie with all plays).

To make a play, the user simply has to click a position on the board so that a piece is placed.
